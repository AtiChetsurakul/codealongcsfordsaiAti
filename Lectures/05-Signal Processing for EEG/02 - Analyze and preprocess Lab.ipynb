    "A Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP) consists of 32 participants/samples. The data is an EEG (and other Physiological responses) record of someone watching a video that induce certain emotion. Thus, Independent Variable (IV) is EEG and Dependent variable (DV) is Emotion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each participant watch 40 videos. Each video is 60 seconds long. The EEG sampling rate is 128 Hz. The trial has 3 seconds pre-trial/fixation. Thus, each trial is 63 seconds and 63 $\\times$ 128 = 8064 time samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, about EEG recording. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an electrical activity of the brain which captures brain activity. We know certain part of the brain is correlated to certain function of a human. Thus, we put multiple sensor on different point of the brain. The sensor/electrode placement guide/convention is 10-20 International system.\n",
