    "\n",
    "- Select one **present** challenge in Kaggle/AICrowd and completed it\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select one **academic paper** and implement it.  Make sure there is no code available in github.  The paper should also be more complicated than simple CNN or LSTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtain an **unique dataset** from your previous company/contacts, and perform modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop a **novel AI-based application**\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliverables will be focused on boosting your resume, toward achieving a good career.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your python (.py)/notebook (.ipynb) file\n",
    "\n",
    "- A medium article that you are proud of\n",

    "- **A**: Valid pipeline, carried out experiments, technically satisfying, shows great understanding\n",
    "- **B**: Valid pipeline, carried out experiments\n",
    "- **C**: Poorly executed work in general\n",
    "- **D**: Couple of hours work / last minute work\n",
    "- **F**: Directly copy from internet, e.g., kaggle, github\n",

    "- Experiments (describe what you compare, how you measure)\n",
